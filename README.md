This repository contains the python file in which the simulation that I designed is and all of the visualizations as well. This file contains a complete single season simulation of the
2024 FBS College Football season using the promotion and relegation model. The purpose of this simulation is to evaluate how effective a promotion and relegation system would be in FBS
football in terms of competitive balance compared to the standard scheduling and playoff design that they have right now. This model is not fully complete in the sense that it only
simulates one year using this system.
